										<h2><a href="#">BRAIN TUMOR DECTECTION </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/p7.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in brain. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are noncancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). The notebook demonstartes a way to classify brain with tumor using SVM and Logistic Learning algorithm..</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/P10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>HR analytics is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources has been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Therefore, it is surprising that HR departments woke up to the utility of machine learning so late in the game. Here is an opportunity to try predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted..</p>

									<p>This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution in which we have to analyze in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">PREDICATING HEART DISEASE </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/P12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Heart Disease is earier to treat when it is detected inthe early stage . Machine learning technique may aid a more efficent analysis in the predication of the disease. Moreover this predication is one of the most central problem in medical , as it is one of the leading desies related to an unhealthy . so an early predication of this disease will be usefull for a curve or aversion.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/P13.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. The dataset is one of the historical sales of supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data. Predictive data analytics methods are easy to apply with this dataset.

Analyzed Sales data of a Supermarket to improve their sales and increase the customer base. Forecasted future sales using modeling techniques Compared all the models and presented the various sales prediction for the upcoming 3 months.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">TAXI FARE PREDICATION </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Taxi fare prediction is an important application of machine learning in the transportation industry. The use of decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms can significantly improve the accuracy of taxi fare predictions.

When applied to taxi fare prediction, these algorithms can take into account various factors that affect the fare, such as distance traveled, time of day, traffic conditions, and weather. By analyzing historical data, the algorithms can learn to make accurate predictions about the cost of a taxi ride in a particular location.

Overall, the use of decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of taxi fare prediction, benefiting both passengers and drivers.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">PREDICATING RAIN IN AUSTRIALIA</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>These models are trained using historical weather data and can analyze various meteorological factors, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and cloud cover. Once trained, the model can make accurate predictions about the likelihood, duration, and intensity of rainfall in a particular area.

One of the key advantages of using machine learning models for rain prediction is their ability to continuously learn and adapt to new data. This means that the accuracy of the model can improve over time as more data becomes available.</p>
